She was forty years old, tall and sturdy, with long, dark brown hair. She radiated a warm but steely confidence when she smiled. Her husband described her as “the picture of health.” Still, her symptoms made them both uneasy. She was mostly concerned about her flagging energy levels. He was fixated on cancer. Noorchashm asked a senior colleague at the Brigham to put him in touch with one of the hospital’s top gynecological oncologists, and in September 2013, as a courtesy between doctors, Michael Muto saw Reed for a consultation.

Muto reviewed the biopsies and scans that had been done. He listened to Reed’s detailed account of her symptoms. There were no alarm bells. Muto wrote in his notes that it was “clearly a benign diagnosis” and he referred her to Karen Wang, then a gynecological surgeon at Brigham, to remove the fibroids.

Reed asked about an abdominal hysterectomy, in which surgeons make a large cut in the abdomen and remove the uterus whole. It was the quickest option and she figured the surgeons would have a good view of what they were doing. “I’m not a vain person,” she said. “I’ve had six pregnancies. Go ahead and make the incision.” She had seen enough operations to know that she didn’t want them “mucking around in there” for any longer than necessary. In the end, though, she was persuaded to have her entire uterus and cervix taken out through the vagina, assisted by tools and a camera inserted through tiny abdominal incisions in what is called a laparoscopic surgery. Reed said Muto told her she would be crazy to do it any other way—Reed was a busy woman (both she and her husband worked long hours and their brood was still young, between ages one and twelve) and the recovery would be quicker. As promised, the procedure was fast and easy. She spent just two hours in the operating room, was out of hospital the same day and felt pretty much herself two days after that.
