Yes, I'm officially on vacation. I will be on vacation for five glorious days because I am clever. I am smart and have actually managed to schedule several of these 4-5 day vacations through the rest of the year.

I have two days off during the week because working the weekends if fucking ridiculously easy and I can't believe more people don't want to do it. But that's okay, we won't say shit to them about how wonderful it is. We'll continue to tell them how horrid it is, "Oh yah, working the weekend while everyone else is off and out and about doing their thing...man it totally sucks!"
